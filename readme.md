A basic tournament schedule/standings stream tracker for broadcasting short-form multi-match esports tournaments.

tournament-config.json: defines the teams and matches

tourneydefs.py: classes etc

udts.py: WIP full featured but probably jank-filled UI

updatethestream.py: the absolute minimum

Absolute MVP, no blah blah
